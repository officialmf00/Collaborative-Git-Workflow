# just-the-docs-template

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a documentation website that:

- Use the static-site generator [Jekyll];
- uses the [Just the Docs] theme;
- can be built and published on [GitHub Pages] using a [GitHub Actions workflow];

See [a deployed version of this template here].

To get started with creating a site, just fork this repository.

After forking the repository, update it as needed:

## Invite Others to Collaborate with you on this Project

Only one team member needs to clone the repository. They can then give their team members access under the repo's `Settings => Collaborators` page.

The team should then collaboratively work on building out this site according to the assignment instructions.

## Replace the Content of the Template Pages

Update the following files to your own content:

- `index.md` (Your new home page.)
- `README.md` (Replace this readme with some information about your team and team members.)
- `docs\first-doc.md` (Sample nested page. All pages other than home should go in `docs`.)

Remember that you will be using [Markdown Syntax] rather than raw HTML to format the content of your pages.

## Publish your site on GitHub Pages

The following should be done by the team member who owns the repo.

1.  If your created repository is `YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME`, update `_config.yml` to:

    ```yaml
    title: YOUR TITLE
    description: YOUR DESCRIPTION
    theme: just-the-docs

    url: https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME

    aux_links: # remove these two lines if you don't want this link to appear on your pages
      Template Repository: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME
    ```

2.  Push your updated `_config.yml` to your site on GitHub.

3.  In your newly forked version of this repo on GitHub:
    - Go to the `Actions` tab and enable the repository actions.
    - Go to the `Settings` tab -> `Pages` -> `Build and deployment`, then select `Source`: `GitHub Actions`.
    - If there were any failed Actions, go to the `Actions` tab and click on `Re-run jobs`.
    - Test if deployment worked by visiting the `url:` you set in the `_config.yml` file.
    - If the website does not build contact your instructor immediately. 

## Quick Overview Of How This Repo Works

- This repo can generate a documentation website similar to your [Applied Math course notes](https://stungeye.github.io/Applied-Math-For-Games-1/).
- The docs are written using Markdown syntax and converted to a website using Jekyll with the Just the Docs theme.
- The notes consist of modules written as `.md` files in the `docs` folder.
- The sidebar menu and the module table of contents are auto-generated.

Each of these topics is covered below.

## Jekyll and Just the Docs

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a tool that takes plain text documents and turns them into static HTML websites.

Jekyll sites can be hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). GitHub Pages publishing instructions for this repo are described above.

The look and feel of a Jekyll generated website can be changed using a Jekyll theme. These notes use the [Just the Docs theme](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/). The following sections are provided as a quick start guide, but you should reference the [official documentation](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) for the nitty-gritty details on how to work with the theme.

## Writing Notes in Markdown and Editing Notes Online

The notes are written using the [Kramdown-variant of Markdown Syntax](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html). This means the notes are stored as plain text in this repository and converted into an HTML website by Jekyll. There is a small amount of meta-data at the top of each markdown file that [Jekyll calls front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).

Markdown allows us to easily add typographic formatting, links, images, and tables to the notes. Everything you need to know about Markdown can be seen at [the Kramdown Quick Reference](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html).

Some example Markdown:

````markdown
# This is a Heading

## And a Sub-Heading

This paragraph includes **bold**, _italized_, and `monospaced` text, plus a [link](http://stungeye.com).

- Item
- List

```
This is a code block
that spans multiple lines.
```
````

Which outputs:

> # This is a Heading
>
> ## And a Sub-Heading
>
> This paragraph includes **bold**, _italized_, and `monospaced` text, plus a [link](http://stungeye.com).
>
> - Item
> - List
> 
> ```
> This is a code block
> that spans multiple lines.
> ```

## The File and Folder Structure of the Repository

All of your documentation modules will be found in the `docs` folder as Markdown files with `.md` file extensions.

The `docs` folder is currently structured like this:

```
- docs
  - first_doc.md
```

Feel free to create sub-folders within docs to better organize your `*.md` files. Your markdown files will be automatically discovered, even if they are in sub-folder.

## Organizing Modules in the Sidebar Menu

The sidebar menu is automatically generated. The order in which modules are listed in the sidebar menu is controlled using the [Jekyll front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) found at the top of each markdown file. The front-matter looks like this:

```
---
title: Module Title
nav_order: 5
---
```

The `title` specified will be the link title used in the sidebar menu. The `nav_order` controls the order in which modules appear in the sidebar menu.

## Adding an Autogenerated Table of Contents to a Module

You can add an auto-generated Table of Contents to any module. This only works well if you break your module into sections and sub-section using level 2 and level 3 headers (created in markdown with two or three hash `#` marks preceeding your headings).

The code used to add the table of contents is as follows. This should go directly after the front matter:

```markdown
<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
# Main Title for Module 
{: .no_toc }

A short introductory paragraph for the module to come before the table of contents.

## Table of Contents
{: .no_toc }

1. TOC
{:toc}

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->
```

The generated table of contents will replace the two lines that read `1. TOC` and `{:toc}`.

The `{: .no_toc }` statement marks headings that shouldn't be included in the table of contents.

The `<!-- pettier... -->` start and end tags prevents this code from being broken by the Prettier code formatting plugin for VS Code. The blank line above the prettier-ignore-end tag is crucial.
